Each question `.md` file (referenced from `questions.json` as `description`) must follow this Jira Markdown template:

```
*Background:* [Brief context — 1-2 sentences explaining why this matters]

*Question:* [Clear, specific question]

*Options:*
- Option A: [Brief description]
- Option B: [Brief description]
- Option C: [Brief description if needed]

*Recommended Decision:* [Write your proposed answer here]
```

Rules:
- Do NOT repeat the summary in the description — start directly with `*Background:*`
- Use Jira Markdown: `*bold*`, `-` for bullets, no `**` or `#` headers
- `*Recommended Decision:*` is required — always provide your best guess even if uncertain
- Keep options focused: 2–3 max; omit if only one valid path exists
